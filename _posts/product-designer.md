## About Agora

Agora is working towards a new paradigm for group collaboration by creating the tools for communities to work together onchain. This is not yet-another-productivity-saas. We believe that to enable the next era of collaboration, we need software that can bend current and create new incentives. No amount of removing friction will change how we work together if our reward functions are misaligned.

So to this end, Agora is working tirelessly on the best end-to-end governance platform for crypto protocols – the first instance of at scale onchain collaboration. Leading communities like Optimism, ENS, Uniswap, Nouns, and more rely on Agora to coordinate their community around critical protocol upgrades, ecosystem funding, and steward their ecosystem for the future.

But that’s not where we stop. Our goal is to build deep collaboration tools for people who couldn’t care less about crypto so that one day (soon), your friends back home are using Agora without ever knowing we’re on Ethereum.

## What you'll do
- Own product design end to end at Agora, with support from our design co-founder
- Shape the product requirement and provide input into the roadmap (we have no PMs)
- Work with engineer to establish and improve our design system
- Be the standard bearer for product quality and user experience

## What we are looking for
We're open to strong designers of any experience level and are willing to build the position around you. We're more excited about talent and ambition than years of experience. Senior candidates can expect to be the leader of the function, with our design co-founder playing a support role. Earlier career candidates will receive more active mentorship and coaching from our design co-founder. No matter the experience level, a strong candidate will have:

- Strong visual and interaction design chops.
- Technical literacy – you're as comfortable in Github as your engineering peers are in Figma, and understand frontend enough to co-create a robust design system in collaboration with your eng peers.
- A mind for product strategy: We have no PMs – and believe in a culture of empowered designers and engineers directly shaping the definition of the product they are building.
- You are proud and passionate about Crypto, Internet communities, and Open Source.
- You love onchain governance like us :)

## What we offer

- A culture lead by design: our co-founder is a designer! You'll be working closely with him and be able to stretch as far into product and engineering as you desire.
- Ownership – both in responsibility and equity. We’re a small team with high trust and expectations of each other. We want you to own a sizable chunk of of the product and company, and structure our compensation accordingly.
- Competitive benefits – in addition to good health and dental benefits, we trust all employees with a no-limit company card and equal access to our executive assistant to use however they see fit to increase their productivity.
- A strong team – we’re a small team that values experience, character and integrity. You’ll work with peers you respect, and who respect you.
- A seat at the table – you will come to all off sites, and be part of all strategic discussions. We’re hiring for a technical leader, and will treat you as such.
- A path to grow – our goal is to retain all early hires as senior leaders as the company scales. We believe folks with the best expertise and deep context should lead organizations, even if they don’t traditionally self-identify as people managers.
- Remote friendly, but PST or EST timezones preferred.
